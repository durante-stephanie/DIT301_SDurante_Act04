## How did you implement event handling?
- Used `setOnClickListener` for the Submit button.  
- When clicked, it checks if all fields are filled and shows a message on the screen.

## What techniques ensured smooth and stable interaction?
- Used input validation to prevent empty submissions.  
- Displayed feedback using a TextView instead of pop-up alerts.  

## What improvements would you add in future versions?
- I would add more input checks and include animations for better feedback.
